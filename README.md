# Monte Carlo Tree Search Tic-Tac-Toe
### Overview
This project implements a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agent to play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The MCTS agent trains through self-play and evaluates its performance by playing against a random agent. The progress of the agent is visualized over time, showcasing its improvement in gameplay.

### Features
- MCTS Agent: An implementation of the MCTS algorithm tailored for Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Self-Play Training: The MCTS agent trains by playing against itself.
- Evaluation Against Random Agent: Assess the agent's performance by competing with a random move selector.
- Visualization: Graphs displaying win rates and game outcomes over training iterations.
- Logging: Separate logging for training and testing phases for detailed analysis.

# TicTacToe MCTS Gym Environment

A custom TicTacToe environment built using OpenAI's Gym framework, enhanced with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. This project provides a robust foundation for developing and testing intelligent agents in the classic TicTacToe game setting.

## Project Description

This repository implements a TicTacToe game environment compatible with OpenAI Gym, allowing seamless integration with reinforcement learning algorithms. The core of the project leverages the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to enable intelligent decision-making, making it an excellent tool for studying game strategies and developing AI agents.


### Features

- **Intelligent Gameplay**: MCTS enables the agent to make strategic moves by evaluating potential future states.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allows for easy extension and integration with other algorithms or game environments.
- **Structured Codebase**: Clear and well-documented classes and methods facilitate understanding and further development.

### Usage

Run the training script to start the MCTS agent training:
```bash
python your_script_name.py
